The theme of NECCDC 2023 is "Resilient Cloud Infrastructures".  Modern cloud providers, containerization, and orchestration technologies have enabled organizations to massively scale their infrastructures. At the same time, the presence of availability zones has enabled organizations to guarantee high availability (> 99.99%) of critical services. These massively scalable, highly available, and public infrastructures present unique security challenges that require innovative security solutions. This year's qualifier and regional competition will focus on the multitude of techniques that ensure enterprise network uptime, security, and flexibility-even when operating at a massive scale. 

Blue Teams will need to maintain, secure, and scale highly available services while also juggling compliance with service level agreements.
