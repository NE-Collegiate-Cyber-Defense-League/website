The Northeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NECCDC) tests each team's ability to operate, secure, manage, and maintain a corporate network. This competition creates as closely as possible, a realistic corporate administration and security experience - giving the competitors a chance to compare their education and training against their peers and the real world challenges that await them. 

> The 2020 NECCDC was hosted as a remotely accessible virtual event during March 21st and 22nd, 2020. This was due to the global COVID-19 pandemic taking place at the time.

## Theme

The theme of NECCDC 2020 was visibility

In the Cybersecurity Industry, visibility can be defined as:
> The facilitation of an unobstructed view into the operation of security controls and ease of organized access to information relevant to responding to security incidents efficiently.

### Concepts involved in the theme of visibility include

* Inventory of assets and services
* Development and documentation of consistent technology processes
* Awareness of activity on various systems involved in providing services

### Technologies that often help improve visibility

* Log collection and analysis systems
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
* Network Intrusion Detection Systems

Visibility is the foundation for awareness of anomalies, completed by an organization's ability to implement effective security controls, and respond well to incidents:
