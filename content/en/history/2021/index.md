The Northeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NECCDC) tests each team's ability to operate, secure, manage, and maintain a corporate network. This competition creates as closely as possible, a realistic corporate administration and security experience - giving the competitors a chance to compare their education and training against their peers and the real world challenges that await them. 

> The 2021 NECCDC was hosted as a remotely accessible virtual event during March 19th 20th and 21st, 2021. This was due to the global COVID-19 pandemic taking place at the time.

## Theme

The theme of NECCDC 2021 was Mobility

The scenario placed student competitors as employees of NEWSCRIER.ORG. NewsCrier is a non-profit global news agency that is responsible for collecting and verifying news in many countries. During the NECCDC 2021 Regionals, you will be working as the NewsCrier global security team supporting offices in multiple countries and additional critical NewsCrier systems.

A Quote from the 2021 Team Packet regarding the years theme:

> "As the industry has seen in the last year, computer systems and the data they house can change location rapidly. Systems may need to be moved with little planning or forethought and that presents a unique set of challenges to those tasked with securing them. This is particularly true when security teams have little time, in advance, to secure the new location of these systems. Securing systems in a mobile landscape presents challenges to traditional security doctrine. Endpoint detection and identity management become paramount while perimeter security and the utilization of trusted systems become much harder. Similarly, supporting these systems and their users becomes more challenging."
