As a measure to reduce spam, NECCDL requires all participants to verify their Discord accounts before being allowed into the general NECCDL Discord server.
You can verify your account in one of two ways:

## Verify via the NECCDL Discord Server

You can visit the linked roles section of the NECCDL Discord server click the verification option for the NECCDL verification bot.

Find the role labeled **Verified** that has the NECCDL verification bot icon next to it and click the button to start the verification process.

After completing the verification process, you will receive a role in the NECCDL Discord server that grants you access.
